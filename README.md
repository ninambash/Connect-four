# Connect Four Pitch
First Four is a two-player board game in which the players first choose a color and then take turns dropping one colored disc from the top into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column.
The mission for the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own discs.
